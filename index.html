        <p>
            Hello, my name is Neiro Cabrera and I am an aspiring Software Engineer and Computer Science Major at UCLA. 
            I have experience working on Full Stack Development and Internet of Things as evidenced by my projects. 
            I have interest in gaining an entry-level software job in those fields or expanding my knowledge in Security or Embedded Systems. 
            In end, I really enjoy learning and being adaptable to learn new skills quickly. 
            I believe teamwork and communication are important in any collaborative project I do and would plan to apply those skills in industry when I get my first entry level position. 
            Reach out to me through my email (neirocabrera7@gmail.com) if there are any opportunities I can get involved in!
