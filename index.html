        <p>
            Hello, my name is Neiro Cabrera and I am an aspiring Software Engineer and Computer Science Major at UCLA. 
            I have experience working on Full Stack Development and Internet of Things as evidenced by my projects. 
            I have interest in gaining an entry-level software job in those fields or expanding my knowledge in Security or Embedded Systems. 
            In end, I really enjoy learning and being adaptable to learn new skills quickly. 
            I believe teamwork and communication are important in any collaborative project I do and would plan to apply those skills in industry when I get my first entry level position. 
            Reach out to me through my email (neirocabrera7@gmail.com) if there are any opportunities I can get involved in!
        </p>

            <p>
                This project's purpose is to bring exposure to concepts regarding Fourth Industrial Revolution and Industry 4.0 at minimal cost. 
                This is specifically designed for demonstrations at the High School level and more in depth training at the college level. 
                Additionally, the demo serves as a great starting point for anyone interested in learning on a functioning prototype.
